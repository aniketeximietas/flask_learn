           "message": "2.6 Ordering and Receive Buffer Flow Control  Flow Control (FC) is used to prevent overflow of Receiver buffers and to  enable compliance with the ordering rules  defined inSection2.4. Note that the Flow Control mechanism is used by the  Requester to track the queue/buffer space  available in the agent across the Link as shown inFigure 2-48. That is,  Flow Control is point-to-point (across a Link) and  not end-to-end. Flow Control does not imply that a Request has reached  its ultimate Completer.  Intermediate Ultimate  Requester Link Link  Component(s) Completer  OM13776  Figure 2-48 Relationship Between Requester and Ultimate Completer  Flow Control is orthogonal to the data integrity mechanisms used to  implement reliable information exchange between  Transmitter and Receiver. Flow Control can treat the flow of TLP  information from Transmitter to Receiver as perfect,  since the data integrity mechanisms ensure that corrupted and lost TLPs  are corrected through retransmission (see  Section3.6).  Each Virtual Channel maintains an independent Flow Control credit pool.  The FC information is conveyed between two  sides of the Link using DLLPs. The VC ID field of the DLLP is used to  carry the VC ID that is required for proper Flow  Control credit accounting.  Flow Control mechanisms used internally within an MFD are outside the  scope of this specification.  Flow Control is handled by the Transaction Layer in cooperation with the  Data Link Layer. The Transaction Layer  performs Flow Control accounting functions for Received TLPs and “gates”  TLP Transmissions based on available credits  for transmission even if those TLPs are eventually nullified..  Note: Flow Control is a function of the Transaction Layer and, therefore,  the following types of information transmitted  on the interface are not associated with Flow Control Credits: LCRC,  Packet Framing Symbols, other Special Symbols,  Page 1875.0-1.0-PUB—PCI Express® Base Specification Revision 5.0 Version  1.0  and Data Link Layer to Data Link Layer inter-communication packets. An  implication of this fact is that these types of  information must be processed by the Receiver at the rate they arrive  (except as explicitly noted in this specification).  Also, any TLPs transferred from the Transaction Layer to the Data Link  and Physical Layers must have first passed the  Flow Control “gate”.",
